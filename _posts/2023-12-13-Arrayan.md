Arrayán is a revolutionary web application seamlessly integrated with the ResilientDB blockchain fabric, empowering industries to achieve end-to-end transparency in tracking products, by-products, and their historical journey across the supply chain. Tailored especially for the food sector, Arrayán offers an intuitive platform to visualize the lifecycle of goods from farm to retail, fostering accountability and trust at every stage.

Beyond traditional tracking, Arrayán redefines traceability as a driver of sustainability. The platform introduces a forward-thinking mechanism to reclaim and repurpose food by-products—such as stems, peels, and seeds—by securely documenting their origin, usage intent, and transfer timelines on the blockchain. This verifiable, tamper-proof data unlocks opportunities to scale the reuse of by-products as raw materials in sectors like cosmetics and clean energy production.

With seamless blockchain-backed agreements and instant access to tracking data through lightweight tools, Arrayán ensures a frictionless experience for producers, buyers, and consumers alike. It transforms traceability into a dynamic ecosystem for innovation, collaboration, and resource optimization—all while championing a more transparent and circular economy.

- We have modified the existing ResilientDB-GraphQL APIs catering to the needs of a blockchain-based food supply chain and added a new API to fetch the products in the forked [repo](https://github.com/Amoolya-Reddy/ResilientDB-GraphQL).


## Problem Identified

Scientific evidence supports the potential of food by-products as valuable sources of molecules for the cosmetic industry. However, their utilization has been limited as the chemical composition and yield variability are influenced by factors such as variety, environmental conditions, and the methods of cultivation and processing. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive traceability for most by-products, hindering the recording of crucial data. This absence of information results in a lack of standardization, contributing to uncertain yields and increased costs associated with the extraction and purification processes. A parallel challenge is observed in the use of by-products for hydrogen production and other upcycling applications.

## Solution

This web application plays a pivotal role in meticulously tracing the generation of by-products at each stage. This granular information is instrumental in standardizing by-products, facilitating their upcycling on a larger scale, and pinpointing key areas where substantial amounts of by-products are produced. Our traceability-for-sustainability model not only offers a blueprint for companies to embrace circular economy models but also ensures compliance with regulations such as the Food Safety Modernization Act.
The primary objective of the Food Safety Modernization Act is to enhance food safety. In the event of a foodborne incident, rapid tracking within 24 hours is mandated. The regulation emphasizes the necessity for companies to share information seamlessly across their supply chain, and blockchain emerges as a powerful tool to streamline this process.
Arrayán stands as more than just a tracing tool; it is a catalyst for the food industry to not only meet regulatory requirements but also to potentially increase profitability from their by-products and reduce its environmental footprint.
**During the development of the application, we established a partnership with the teaching and research winery of UC Davis. To kick-start our journey, we are delivering a Proof of Concept utilizing the data generously provided by our collaborators.**

*Note: Arrayán also aligns with Senate Bill 1883, offering a pathway to compliance with this additional regulation.*

## Architecture

The sequence diagrams of the inventory manager, product tracker, smart Contract and chrome extension below give an overview of the function triggers and the process of upload/claim.

**Inventory Manager**

Upon breaking the overall architecture, the user is authenticated and will be provided with a dashboard, current inventory, and product tracker.
1. Dashboard fetches data from the Google Firestore and displays the real-time data in sync with the ResilientDb.
2. After uploading the inventory from an Excel file or providing the manual input, transactions are constructed to the Schema required for the GraphQL server of ResilientDb, and POST_TRANSACTION mutation is used to save the data to the ResilientDb. Upon a successful response, transaction IDs are stored in the Google Firestore. Only transaction IDs and metadata are saved outside the ResilientDb, ensuring data transparency on the global-scale blockchain fabric — ResilientDb.
3. When a user searches for a product, the relevant transaction IDs are retrieved from Google Firestore, and point queries are made to ResilientDb. The complete food supply chain is displayed, detailing each stage. The system also allows users to claim byproducts generated during the process. Claimed byproducts are recorded as transactions on ResilientDb, with their transaction IDs securely stored in Google Firestore.
